Standalone Apple Watch Music App

About The Project
[Apple Watch For Your Kids](https://support.apple.com/en-us/109036) allows family members to use their Apple Watch to do things like make phone calls, send messages all without a connected phone.  Unfortunately though the are no standalone music apps that can be used with the watch when configured in this way except Apple music which requires a subscription and can use celluar data. I wanted to develop an app where I can add music directly to an Apple Watch, and play it.
